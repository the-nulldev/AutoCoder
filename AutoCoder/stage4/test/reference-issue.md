## Issue label:

## Issue description: 

Create a Node.js project structure with the following directories and files:
- an `src` directory containing the index.js entry point,
- a `package.json` at the root with metadata and dependencies,
- a `.gitignore` file at the root to exclude node_modules and .env,
- a `README.md` providing a brief project description.
Ensure `index.js` in `src` sets up an Express server listening on port 3000. Populate `package.json` with only the necessary Express dependencies.
Provide JSON-formatted snippets for each file, with keys as paths like `src/index.js` and corresponding values as file contents.
